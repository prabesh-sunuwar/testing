    <h2 style="color: rgb(237, 36, 36);">BSc (Hons) Computing</h2><br>
    This course is designed to give the students the opportunity to explore different ideas, developing innovate solutions of improvements to current issues in the computing industry. This program covers the fundamental principles that are key to computing technology and its various uses.
    Throughout this degree, students will cover software engineering methods, database implementation and system design, with multiple users and multiple platforms in mind. It also includes background theory, practical implications of knowledge-based systems, neural networks and evolutionary algorithms on the development of artificial intelligence systems. During the first year, all computing students will share the same module and in years two and three, the students will have the flexibility and choice to focus on specialism under a range of topics.
